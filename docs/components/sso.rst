Single Sign-On
==============

If needed, an IAM (Identity and Access Management) service can be deployed
to manage users and authentication in Software Factory components that
allow it.

User and authentication management is ensured by the `Keycloak component <https://www.keycloak.org>`_.

A more detailed description of how the service is deployed and used within
Software Factory is available in the :ref:`Keycloak operator documentation
<authentication>`.
