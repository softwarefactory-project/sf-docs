Software Factory (also called SF) is a collection of services that provides
a powerful platform to build software. It's designed to
use an OpenStack-based cloud for resources, but it can also be used with static
resources.

Setting up a development environment manually can really be
time consuming and sometimes leads to a lot of configuration
trouble. SF provides an easy way to get all services configured
and running.

SF feature an automated upgrade process continuously tested with integration test.
