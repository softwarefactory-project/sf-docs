Until then, the restore is not that usefull.",

      "message": "Looking at the diff between sf_recover and sf_restore that really minimal. The sf_restore:\n\n1/ prepare the backup directory for the archive extraction then extract.\n2/ Stop services before calling restores actions of services.\n3/ Call sfconfig\n\nThe 1 is no longer needed I think.\nThe 2 can be added in the sf_recover even if is case of a new node stopping services is useful but enable sf_recover for a running system.\nThe 3 is not needed because sf_recover call is wrapped by sfconfig already.\n\nSo my point is with not su much changes we can remove sf_restore.yml and use sf_recover.yml in both cases.\n\nFinally maybe we can consider fine grained restoration must be handled by hand so no need for a playbook for that ?",
