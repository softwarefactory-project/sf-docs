How can I help?
===============
Thanks for asking. Let's find a place for you! 
First you should join our communication forums: 

* Join us on IRC: You can talk to us directly in #softwarefactory channels
* Read the official Software Factory documentation

Then you should deploy your own softwarefactory: 

* Create a Ubuntu-14 virtual machine to host your development environment
* Configure your new vm with the sfstack project:
    * git clone http://softwarefactory.enovance.com/r/sfstack.git
    * cd sfstack
    * ./sfstack

Feel free to hack the code and update your deployment!

How to contribute
=================

* Connect to softwarefactory.enovance.com using your Github account
* Check the bugtracker and the pending reviews
* Submit your change:
    * Use git-review
    * Check the status of tests there: http://softwarefactory.enovance.com/_zuul/
* Software Factory is developed using Software Factory. That means that you can contribute to SF in the same way you would contribute to any other project hosted on SF: :ref:`contribute`
